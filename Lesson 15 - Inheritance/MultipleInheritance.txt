Java doesn't support multiple inheritance mainly to avoid the complexities and ambiguities 
associated with it, like the diamond problem. 
Instead, Java encourages interface implementation, which provides similar flexibility without the drawbacks of multiple inheritance, 
promoting simpler and more maintainable code.
