JVM - Java Virtual Machiene 

Code doesent work directly on hardware
Since Java is platform independent, all this is possible because of JVM

But JVM is platform dependent (Eg. Not supported on IOS)



Java Code --> Compiler (javac) --> Byte Code --> JVM --> OS -> Hardware

 This diagram illustrates the process of executing Java code:
 
 1. Java source code is compiled by the Java compiler (javac) into bytecode (.class files).
 
 2. Bytecode is platform-independent and can be executed on any system with a compatible JVM.

 3. The JVM loads and executes the bytecode, interacting with the underlying operating system as necessary.

 4. The operating system manages hardware resources and facilitates communication between the JVM and hardware.
